### Project Proposal: Development of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Model for Financial Question Answering Using Medtronic's Annual Reports

#### Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model that can effectively answer financial questions based on Medtronic's annual reports. This model will leverage both retrieval and generation capabilities to provide accurate and contextually relevant answers to users.

### Project Phases

#### Phase 1: Data Collection
1. **Identify Data Sources**
   - Collect Medtronic's annual reports from the official Medtronic website, SEC filings, and financial databases (e.g., EDGAR).
   - Gather supplementary financial data (e.g., stock performance, market analysis) for context.

2. **Data Acquisition**
   - Use web scraping tools (e.g., BeautifulSoup, Scrapy) to automate the collection of annual reports in PDF or HTML format.
   - Store the collected data in a structured format (e.g., CSV, JSON).

3. **Data Storage**
   - Set up a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) to store the collected reports and supplementary data for easy retrieval.

#### Phase 2: Data Preprocessing
1. **Text Extraction**
   - Use libraries like PyMuPDF or pdfplumber to extract text from PDF reports.
   - Clean and preprocess the text (remove headers, footers, and irrelevant sections).

2. **Data Structuring**
   - Organize the extracted text into a structured format (e.g., paragraphs, sections) for better retrieval.
   - Annotate key financial metrics and terms for enhanced understanding.

3. **Indexing**
   - Create an index of the processed text using a vector database (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone) to facilitate efficient retrieval.

#### Phase 3: RAG Implementation
1. **Model Selection**
   - Choose a suitable pre-trained language model (e.g., BERT, T5, GPT) for the generation component.
   - Implement a retrieval mechanism using the indexed data.

2. **RAG Architecture**
   - Integrate the retrieval and generation components to form a RAG model.
   - Fine-tune the model on a dataset of financial questions and answers to improve performance.

3. **Training**
   - Use transfer learning techniques to adapt the model to the financial domain.
   - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, and BLEU score.

#### Phase 4: UI Development
1. **User Interface Design**
   - Design a user-friendly interface for users to input financial questions.
   - Include features such as question history, suggested questions, and a display area for answers.

2. **Frontend Development**
   - Use frameworks like React or Vue.js to build the frontend.
   - Ensure the UI is responsive and accessible.

3. **Backend Development**
   - Set up a backend server (e.g., Flask, FastAPI) to handle user requests and interact with the RAG model.
   - Implement API endpoints for question submission and answer retrieval.

#### Phase 5: Guard Rail Implementation
1. **Safety Measures**
   - Implement guard rails to prevent the model from generating harmful or misleading information.
   - Use techniques such as content filtering, response validation, and user feedback loops.

2. **Ethical Considerations**
   - Ensure compliance with financial regulations and ethical guidelines in AI usage.
   - Provide disclaimers about the limitations of the model and the importance of consulting financial professionals.

#### Phase 6: Testing
1. **Unit Testing**
   - Conduct unit tests for individual components (data collection, preprocessing, RAG model, UI).

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test the entire system to ensure all components work together seamlessly.

3. **User Testing**
   - Conduct user testing sessions to gather feedback on usability and performance.
   - Iterate on the model and UI based on user feedback.

4. **Performance Evaluation**
   - Evaluate the model's performance on a separate validation set of financial questions.
   - Analyze the accuracy and relevance of the answers generated.
